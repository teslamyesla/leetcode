Bottom up 1D DP
Time Complexity : O(mâ‹…n), where m is the subSetSum = total // 2, and n is the number of stones. 
Space Complexity: O(m), As we use an array of size m to store the result of subproblems.

Note:
1. Key trick is to transform problem to find target cloest to total // 2
2. Similiar as 416 (https://github.com/teslamyesla/leetcode/blob/master/python/416-partition-equal-subset-sum.py), but instead of true false, dp[i] stores max amount achievable that <= i
